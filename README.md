# ðŸ’¸ Budget Service

This is a template for a golang application that can be used and deployed to AWS Lambda from the Monorepo. 

To get started, you can simply copy and paste this directory into a new project folder within the Monorepo.

## Development 

This uses Go, the Gin HTTP Package, makefiles, and github actions to be able to deploy to AWS Lambda directly.

For local development, there's a dockerfile ready to go for the application that will build and run the app.

## Infrastructure

`./infra` is a directory that houses Terraform files, which can then be used to create aws resources using terraform IaC. 
This is deployed using Terraform Cloud.
